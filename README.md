Stone wool board, also known as rock wool insulation decorative board, is basalt as the main raw material, by high temperature melting processing of inorganic fiber board, in June 1981 the volume test successfully rock wool board is a new type of insulation, flame insulation, sound absorption material.

Rock wool board after high temperature melting and processing into artificial inorganic fiber, with light weight, thermal conductivity coefficient small, heat absorption, non-burning characteristics, the initial development in the building is a common application type for industrial buildings should meet the requirements of "building insulation material application type and basic requirements".

Product features:

1. Rock wool belongs to inorganic heat insulation material, which is made of iron slag as the main raw material after melting and cooling by high-pressure steam injection.

2. Rock wool sandwich board(<a href="http://www.wonzonecn.com/products/"/>cleanroom glass panel</a>) in addition to the general function of thermal insulation of the moving structure, they are widely used in a variety of fire insulation places.

Disadvantages of rock wool board:

1. Rock wool board cannot replace slope finding, so slope finding layer needs to be done.

2. High water absorption rate, water is easy to accumulate in the rock wool board, long time will increase the weight of the insulation layer, resulting in the insulation layer off, high repair rate.

3. Complicated process and long construction period.
